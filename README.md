Abstract 

SportNow will match users by asking them to specify their preferences in what, where, and when
they want to play and then use this information to create “events” for other people to join. During this
matchmaking process, the skill level, location, level of sportsmanship, and preferred sport of players will
be considered. Self­evaluations will be included to try and help match up players of even skill level for
the more competitive players. In short, SportNow is an online web app for easy sports matchmaking.

Customers

There will be several types of customers for SportNow. All can connect to the web, with a laptop
or mobile phone, to access SportNow. These users will vary in their sports background, web proficiency,
and frequency in using SportNow. However, these all enjoy playing sports with convenience.
One type of customer loves playing sports competitively and frequently uses the internet. This
customer might enjoy various sports including football, soccer, hockey, basketball, and so on. This user
may have the goal of proving themselves as one of the best players on the app. Because this user uses the
web frequently and likes playing sports, he or she could become a recurring user of SportNow.
Another type of customer might be less enthusiastic about playing sports, and only surf the web
from time to time. However, this customer might be interested in learning how to play a particular sport.
He or she could be interested in SportNow to casually find opponents to play against in just one sport.

Competitive Analysis

There currently exist other apps that help users find others interested in playing sports. In general
these apps seem to be focused more on casual play than competitive play.
A Google search for “play sports with people near you” lists several services: Sporty, SportsVite,
SportsBuddy, Let’s Play!, SportsJig, Find Sports Nearby Me, Timpik, Sportmeets, and PlayWith. These
are marketed to “connect people through sport,” and as “Tinder for sports fans,” with a “focus on sports,
not dating.” Many of these apps allow customers to review each other, chat to coordinate where and when
to play, find games based on their location, and create their own event.
SportsVite’s website looks professional and easy to use. Sportsvite is popular with over 22,000
likes on Facebook. SportsVite has many users in Vancouver, though few are active. A SportsVite profile
includes an individual’s name, age, sports preferences, picture, city, and a short greeting message​.
You can also search for teams, events, and leagues to join on SportsVite. Furthermore, a SportsVite user
can specify their experience, skill level, interest, frequency, availability, and comments​for each sport.
Compared to SportsVite, SportNow’s user profiles will have very similar info. In addition, when you
search for players on SportNow, you can also see how recently they were active on the site. On the other
hand, SportNow will not recognize teams or leagues, but will attempt to focus more on individual skill
rating​.
SportsBuddy is a phone app that can be used by users to find others interested in playing the same
sports. However, unlike other apps in its category, SportsBuddy can be used not only for peer to peer use,
but also by instructors as a networking service to connect them with students. In comparison, SportNow
will focus more on setting up events for users to play sports ​than for teachers to find students and will
be a website rather than a phone app.
SportsJig has 5/5 stars on the Android Store with 45 ratings, and is available for the iPad and
iPhone. SportsJig allows individuals to create a public profile that permits users to become “Sports
Buddies,” lists the sports in which they are interested, and display uploaded photos. SportNow will have a
similar profile layout and buddy system. Another use of SportsJig is that users can find events, “offers”
(i.e. memberships), and classes searchable by location or sport. Conversely, SportNow will not advertise
memberships or classes, but will primarily concentrate on promoting events between its users.
SportsPartner is very popular, having matched over 100,000 people over 8 years, and can be used
from a web browser without requiring a smartphone. SportsPartner allows someone to find a partner to
play with. To do this, SportsPartner users must specify their sport, gender, and age range preference as
well as write a short description of themselves. These users are also able to “hi­five” others or send
messages. SportNow will support user descriptions​, but will not include a “hi­five” system. Because
SportsPartner is not meant for group activities, only a limited range of sports options are provided. This is
a drawback that SportNow will attempt to remedy by offering a wider range of possibilities (e.g. 10­player
soccer or volleyball). Only people in the UK can join SportsPartner, whereas SportNow will have no
region­based restrictions. Unlike SportNow, SportsPartner makes no use of Facebook or other single
sign­on services. The SportsPartner service is simple because it is only for sports involving pairs.
SportNow will support group activities​, requiring more complexity but with a greater potential for
integrating more sports.

Scope

Unlike recreational centers and other apps, our app matches players up quickly and
easily. Setting a time and place to meet up is readily taken care of by the app once users have
filled in the appropriate information. Furthermore, our app helps users find others for
non­competitive sports (such as biking, jogging, etc.) as well as competitive sports. Events in our
app will not be limited to one­on­one matchups, but will also include team sports.
To this end, users will have the ability to self­evaluate their skill level in each sport,
which will allow SportNow to display a list of available events that is relevant to the user. This
skill level rating will also be used to allow users to create events of their own and find other
players of a similar skill level in competitive events. On the other hand, recreational events will
not use a rating system and are going to be more liberal on which users can play against whom.
Thus, the target audience for this app will be people who love playing sports and want to
do so with others in a fast, convenient manner. This web application is also intended for anyone
in search of meeting new people to enjoy competitive or casual sports events with. SportNow
will promote social interactions by allowing people to have the opportunity to meet others who
share the same interests, and individuals who want to meet others can use this program as a tool
to develop social connections.
Features may include user profiles, user preferences, maps, event postings, and an event
search. User preferences can be about preferred sports and skill level, while the event search will
help users find casual or competitive events and the skill range they are interested in playing
with. Users of the app can also leave anonymous “sportsmanship ratings” for users they meet in
order to inform others about whether or not these individuals are courteous, punctual, etc.

Sample Scenarios
1. Jimmy logs into his account. Once logged in, Jimmy selects “Golf ­ Recreational”, and a
feed appears listing all upcoming recreational events for soccer. Jimmy browses through
to find a specific intramural to join, but eventually decides to set up a personal event to
share with others. In the event creation screen, Jimmy is prompted to input what sport he
wants to play, his desired number of players for the event, and his time availability. Upon
selecting “Golf ­ Recreational”, “2 players”, and “4PM ­ 6PM”, Jimmy presses “Enter”
which creates the event. His event gets added to the “Golf ­ Recreational” feed for other
players to see.
2. Jenny needs a way to pass the time until 3PM, when she will pick up her children from
school. Jenny decides that she wants to play tennis, but her friend Wendy is not available
to play today! Browsing on her phone briefly, she finds SportNow on the app store and
gives it a try. She sees that making a profile isn’t too difficult (i.e. name, gender, and
desired sports are the only questions asked during sign­up) and creates an account. When
she selects “Tennis” from the sports menu, she is prompted for her skill level.
Immediately a list of events taking place in the immediate area (as well as where to play)
is generated for her to view. Jenny joins a 2 player event and after a brief conversation
with her opponent they decide to meet at the local park’s tennis court.
3. Alice, Bruce, Charles, Diego, Elliot, and Ferdinand all live at SFU, want to play
basketball, and have an intermediate skill at the sport. By March 31, they have all created
accounts indicating that they like basketball and have a level 3 skill therewith. On April
2, Alice checks the event feed and is shown “No events found! Click here to create one!”
She clicks to create a basketball event, making it “Recreational,” for players with 1­5
skill, on April 7 (see “Create Event” user story). Bruce, Charles, Diego, Elliot, and
Ferdinand all check their event feed between April 3 and April 6. They each find Alice’s
event and join it. They introduce themselves by posting comments on the event page. On
April 7, all six people meet and play basketball, getting along quite well. The next day,
they review each other by going on each others’ profiles and giving each other 5 stars.
